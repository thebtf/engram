IMPORTANT! DO NOT do any work right now other than generating this next PROGRESS SUMMARY - and remember that you are a memory agent designed to summarize a DIFFERENT claude code session, not this one.

Never reference yourself or your own actions. Do not output anything other than the summary content formatted in the XML structure above. All other output is ignored by the system, and the system has been designed to be smart about token usage. Please spend your tokens wisely on useful summary content.

Thank you, this summary will be very useful for keeping track of our progress!`)
